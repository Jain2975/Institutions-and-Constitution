                    Parts 5 and 6 of the Indian Constitution are pivotal in understanding the governance of India. Part 5 outlines the roles and powers of the
                    Union government, including the President, Vice-President, and the Supreme Court, while Part 6 defines the state governments' structure,
                    covering the Governor, State Legislature, and High Courts. Together, they form the foundation of Indiaâ€™s federal structure.
