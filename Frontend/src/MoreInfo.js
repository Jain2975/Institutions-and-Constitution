            <h1>Why Understanding the Constitution Matters</h1>
            <p>
                The Constitution of India serves as the foundation of the country's legal and political system. 
                It defines the structure of government, establishes rights, and sets duties for all citizens. 
                Understanding it is essential for active citizenship and for ensuring that your rights are protected.
            </p>
            <h2>Empower Your Rights and Duties</h2>
            <p>
                The Constitution empowers you to not only know your rights but also to fulfill your duties as a citizen. 
                Whether it's the right to free speech, education, or equality, understanding these principles allows you to 
                participate more effectively in the governance of your nation.
            </p>
            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Knowing the Constitution helps citizens hold the government accountable, stay informed about their legal standing, 
                and ensures they can participate meaningfully in the governance of the country.
